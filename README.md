I used OpenAI to create a dataset with 10,000 rows and 10 columns of random data. It has no meaning other than something I could test with. I then imported this dataset into PowerBi to mess around with integrating Python scripts.
I imported pandas, used the seaborn package and also matplotlib to create the visuals. I like to use mamba forge to manage all packages.
